DevOps practices promote automation, collaboration, and continuous integration, which reduce the time it takes to develop, test, and deploy software.

This results in shorter development cycles, quicker response to customer feedback, and a higher frequency of software releases, ultimately leading to a more efficient and competitive software development process.
