COMP 3104 is one of the courses offered in the Computer Programming Analysis
program at George Brown. It is scheduled for Semester 5 of the program and
during the Fall 2023 semester, Prof. Pritesh Patel is the professor.

This course allows me to see what's behind the industry through the lens of a 
DevOps engineer. It teaches me how to effectively use tools such as GitHub and 
how they can expedite the creation of a new project.
